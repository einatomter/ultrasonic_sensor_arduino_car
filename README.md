## Arduino car with ultrasonic sensor (School project)

This is the first project wherein I worked with Arduino and trying to connect electronic components together.
It is a fairly popular project all around with lots of example codes on the web on how to implement it.
This was mostly to get a feel for coding and fulfilling a school project requirement.
